# nestcheck_demo_data

This repo contains the PolyChord nested sampling run output files which are used in the [nestcheck demo](http://nestcheck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/quickstart_demo.html). You can download the demo as a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ejhigson/nestcheck/blob/master/docs/demos/quickstart_demo.ipynb) and run it yourself using this data.

For more details about the ``nestcheck`` module, see the [github repo](https://github.com/ejhigson/nestcheck) and the [documentation](http://nestcheck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
